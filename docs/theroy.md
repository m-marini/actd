As stated by Sutton, Barton at https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/ebook/the-book.html

"... The reinforcement learning problem is meant to be a straightforward framing of the problem of learning from interaction to achieve a goal ..."

An agent and an environment interact in discrete time step. At each step the agent receives the rappresentation of the environment status and selects an action to change the environment.

The environment change the status as consequence of action performed and produce a reward to the agent.

The goal of agent is to maximize the total reward received.
